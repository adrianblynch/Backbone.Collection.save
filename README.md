Backbone.Collection.save
========================

Various implementations of Backbone.Collection.save().

Almost straight away, newcomers to Backbone have a need, rightly or wrongly, to save many models in a collection in a single request.

This is an attempt to collate the various ways myself and others are recommending this could be done.

Base app
--------

To demo the different versions, a base application called Drinks is available.

Not the most sophisticated of apps, it's in place to see save() working on data in models and collections.
